Advent of Code 2018
===================

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2018]. My original
solutions were written in Python; however, I plan on rewriting at least a
few in some other languages. I tried my hand at solving day 1 with COBOL
running under MVS using my copy of [TK4-], but the compiler is too old...

Where available, you can find timing information in the stats file for each
of my solutions. So far, day 6 is the slowest solution.

Not gonna lie; part 2 of day 7 almost kicked my ass. Clearly, I need to
*spruce* up my coding skills. Also, I haven't even tried to tackle day 15,
yet, because it seems so tedious. I'll probably get back to that at *some*
point, but...not right now.
