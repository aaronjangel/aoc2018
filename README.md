Advent of Code 2018
===================

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2018]. My original
solutions were written in Python; however, I plan on rewriting at least a
few in some other languages. I may even try my hand at running them under
MVS using my copy of [TK4-] under the Hercules emulator. We'll see...

Where available, you can find timing information in the stats file for each
of my solutions. So far, day 6 is the slowest solution.

Not gonna lie; part 2 of day 7 almost kicked my ass. Clearly, I need to
*spruce* up my coding skills.
